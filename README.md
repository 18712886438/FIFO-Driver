## Main Idea
üë®‚Äçüîß Character device driver (/dev) working as a FIFO pipe, created with a Linux Kernel module.
As such, it's SMP-Safe due to the use of semaphores (working as condition variable and mutexes).

Usage: Compile, load the module, create the driver (mknod), use the pipe!


    $ make

    $ sudo insmod fifodev.ko

    $ sudo mknod -m 666 <pathname_char_file> c <major> <minor>
    
    $ # Enjoy your brand-new pipe! #

    ...
